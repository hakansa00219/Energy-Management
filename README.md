# Energy-Management

First big project about Smart Home and Energy Management. Its an application that controls an house that has smart home system and uses an algoritm 
that can shift smart electrical appliances to different time based on the price of electric on that time. Most of the time 06.00 pm to 10.00 pm is 
more expensive than other times so the application shifts evening timed appliances.Also we can add a solar panel to see the profit that we make after we shift.
